# TinyApp

TinyApp is a URL shortener created as one of my projects at Lighthouse Labs.

## Expected Usage

TinyApp is a web server which will give registered users the ability to shorten URLs.
Users must be registered and logged in for full functionality.
Shortened URLs and the correspond long URLs will be stored on the server and remain
accessible to the user who shortened the URL.
